    create:

    This endpoint allows to create a registration for a student.

    In fact, it does three things:

    1. Create a user for the student
    2. Create the registration
    3. Create a student profile and link it to the user and the registration.

    ### Date of birth

    Date of birth must be sent in a ISO-compliant format (in Javascript,
    `Date.toISOString()` can be used for this).

    ### Address

    Address format is the following :

        {
            "line1": "...",
            "line2": "...",
            "post_code": "...",
            "city": "...",
            "country": "..."
        }

    `line2` : optional, default is `""`.

    `country` : optional, default is `"FR"`. Must be given as a
    [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code).

    ### Emergency contact

    Emergency contact format is the following:

        {
            "first_name": "...",
            "last_name": "...",
            "email": "...",
            "home_phone": "...",
            "mobile_phone": "..."
        }

    `email` must be a valid email address. Phone format for `home_phone`
    and `mobile_phone` is not verified.

    ### School

    The value given must be the school's `uai_code`.
    You can retrieve the list of available schools thanks to the
    [schools-choices](#schools-choices) endpoint.
